In this repository I upload Natural-Language-Processing exercises

Tweets about Suicide is the first small project I have done to practice NLP skills: https://github.com/sueqian6/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/tweets%20about%20suicide.ipynb

this one about NBA games is the second project : https://github.com/sueqian6/Predicting-the-results-of-NBA-games-using-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Classification-Models
